== Server Side Includes

You can place static include files or executables in the ssi folder.
The static files will be place right after the body or just before the
end of the body.

IMPORTANT: This has *nothing to do* with the Apache module 'mod_include'
and just implements the nagios way of SSIs.

There are two global includes, which will be included in every cgi
page:

* ssi/common-footer.ssi
* ssi/common-header.ssi

and there are page specific includes, which will only be placed in the
specific page:

* ssi/status-footer.ssi
* ssi/status-header.ssi

Files will be statically placed inside the output of the normal cgi
output. Executables will be executed and the output will then be used
as content.
