== Command Line Tool

The command line tool 'thruk' allows the export of excel files and
other reports. When using the source installation, the cli tool is in
script/thruk, when using the packages it will be installed in
'/usr/bin/thruk' and should be directly available in your PATH. Using
the cli tool makes it easy to send regular reports by cron/mail.

Examples:

export the event log as excel file:

------------
  %> thruk -A thrukadmin 'showlog.cgi?view_mode=xls' > eventlog.xls
------------

More examples can be found in the man page or by running 'thruk -h'.



== Scripting

It is possible to do comprehensive scripting with Thruk. For example
set downtimes automatically, schedule reports or change the objects
of your monitoring core configuration.

See link:/api/Thruk/Utils/CLI.html[CLI API] for details and examples.

There are also some scripting examples in the examples folder.



== Integration With 3rd Party Software

=== Configuration Generators
If your Naemon configuration is generated by a 3rd party config
generator, you can export some additional information which is then
displayed in the configuration section of each host or service.
Just export the special custom variables: '_SRC', '_SRC2' or '_SRC3'.
