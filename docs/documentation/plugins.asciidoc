Plugins
=======

Thruk is easily extenable with plugins and there are some plugins
already included. Plugins itself reside in the
'plugins/plugins-available' directory. Activate a plugin by creating a symlink
in the 'plugins/plugin-enabled' directory. If you use the packaged Thruk
version, the plugins folder is directly in your Thruk folder. If you are using
OMD, the plugins folder is in $OMD_ROOT/etc/thruk/plugins.
Make sure you restart Thruk / Apache after enabling / disabling
plugins.

WARNING: With Thruk 2.0 a few minor changes are required for plugins. If you
have own custom plugins, the link:thruk_2_0_migration_guide.html[Migration Guide] will
help you getting them to work with Thruk 2.0.

Later versions of Thruk have a plugins manager included in the config
tool and you can manage your plugins there.

Example of a plugins folder with all except the mobile plugin (which is not
yet finished) enabled.

Writing your own plugins
------------------------

The directory structure of a plugin is similar to a normal perl
module. The following example has lib, static content, templates and
tests. But you don't need all of them.

TIP: Let me know if you want to get your plugin listed here.

++++
<pre style="line-height:18px;">
  ├── lib
  │   └── Thruk
  │       └── Controller
  ├── root
  │   └── images
  ├── t
  └── templates
</pre>
++++

.Structure
* 'lib' containts all Perl files
* 'root' contains all static content
* 't' keep the tests here
* 'templates' contains all template files for dynamic pages

TIP: Easiest way would be to copy an existing plugin and change it to your
needs.
